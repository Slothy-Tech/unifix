<h2>🚫 What Is an HWID Ban?</h2>
<p>An HWID ban, or Hardware ID ban, blocks your entire PC — not just your account. Anti-cheat systems like <strong>Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC)</strong>, <strong>BattlEye</strong>, and <strong>Epic's Easy Anti-Cheat</strong> scan your hardware and create a fingerprint of your system. If you're flagged, they ban that fingerprint.</p>

<p>Even if you make a new account or reinstall the game, the ban stays in place. That’s where our <strong>HWID Spoofer</strong> comes in — it changes your hardware IDs so you can play again without being detected.</p>

<hr />

<h2>🎮 Games That Use EAC, BattlEye, and Easy Anti-Cheat</h2>
<p>This HWID fix works for all major games using these anti-cheats:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Easy Anti-Cheat:</strong> The Finals, Fortnite, Rust, Dead by Daylight, Apex Legends</li>
  <li><strong>BattlEye:</strong> PUBG, DayZ, Escape from Tarkov, Rainbow Six Siege, Arma 3</li>
  <li><strong>EAC (Epic's EAC):</strong> Fall Guys, Elden Ring, Warface, Halo: MCC</li>
</ul>

<p>If your game uses any of these, and you're HWID banned, this guide is for you.</p>

<hr />

<h2>⚙️ How Our HWID Spoofer Fix Works (Step-by-Step)</h2>
<p>Our all-in-one tool spoofs key hardware components that anti-cheat systems use to track you:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Disk Drive Serial Numbers</strong></li>
  <li><strong>MAC Address</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Motherboard ID</strong></li>
  <li><strong>CPU & GPU IDs</strong></li>
  <li><strong>BIOS UUIDs</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>These spoofed values make your PC look like a brand-new, unbanned machine — even to advanced anti-cheats like BattlEye and EAC.</p>

<h3>✨ What Makes It Different?</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Universal Compatibility:</strong> Works with all major anti-cheat systems — no separate spoofers needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Beginner-Friendly:</strong> Designed for non-tech users. Just follow the guide, click, and go.</li>
  <li><strong>Updated Constantly:</strong> We patch it quickly after anti-cheat updates to stay safe and undetected.</li>
  <li><strong>No Cost:</strong> 100% free and open-source. No locked features, no bait-and-switch.</li>
</ul>
